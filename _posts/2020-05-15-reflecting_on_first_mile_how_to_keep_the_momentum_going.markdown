It has been a month since I began my part-time online software engineering course.  In this month, I feel like I have learned a lot yet still have only scratched the surface. In the First Mile, I have done quite a few labs, and many of them I'm still baffled how I managed to complete them. I love challenges, and this course is challenging my mind in ways I haven't experienced before. This time next year, I hope I'm reminiscing about where I am now and how much I've learned. Even though I am honestly struggling with some of the labs, I know that I will eventually get to the point where all of this just comes naturally.

I am glad that we have the pod meetings. I can't always make it to the online study groups, and some of them have so many people that we might not get to a lab that I am struggling with. The pod meeting allows me to learn in a smaller setting, which I think is the best environment for me to feel comfortable asking questions and engaging in the group. I acknowledge that I can try to be more engaged in the Skype chat, and I will work on participating more in the chat in the coming weeks.

Overall, I am really enjoying the course as I love learning new things, especially something that could be a thriving career for me in the near future. My goal in the coming weeks is to start working harder to grasp the concepts of the various methods. I think that is what I struggle with the most. Once I get a better understanding of why we use certain methods, it will hopefully make it easier for me to develop the codes.
