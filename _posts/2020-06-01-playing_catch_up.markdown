The past couple of weeks I've really struggled with the labs. I have difficulty grasping the concepts of the methods. I believe that's where I am falling short. I need to set aside a day or two (or three...or more) to comprehend everything. This week I will work on catching up on everything I've missed. I hope I haven't fallen too far behind. Admittedly, I need to do a better job of using the resources...

All I can do now is gather my thoughts and push myself to get through these next few lessons. It's times like these that I really appreciate the code-along labs. I will probably update this blog with my progress throughout the rest of the week.
